<p><a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> is an iOS app that allows you to create custom automation for your iOS devices using <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>It provides integrations to a lot of native features of iOS such as file manager, calendars and widgets so you can build almost everything you can think of. It is similar to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334">iOS Siri Shortcut</a>, but instead of having to use that clunky no-code UI, you get a nice little code editor that allows you to write raw script using latest ECMAScript version.</p>
<p>Each Scriptable scripts can be shared (they also have built-in Gallery), and this repository will be used to show some scripts that I made. If you find it useful, you can follow the instruction to download it and use it on your iOS devices.</p>
